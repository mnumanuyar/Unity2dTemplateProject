# Unity2dTemplateProject
Unity 2021.3.8f1 based 2d template project

Feel free to branch and download this project to start a new 2d game.

## Hosting on githubpages
In order to host the project on github pages, a couple project setting changes is enough.
For reference I fallowed [this](https://medium.com/@aboutin/host-unity-games-on-github-pages-for-free-2ed6b4d9c324) tutorial.
In addition I had to set build compression disabled


## Todo:

- add automation 
- issue templates
- script to remove template specific files (i.e. this readme! )
- (feel free to request anything else)
